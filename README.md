This is a PCB made to replace the X and Y drivers used the Prusa MK2(S) or MK2.5(S) series of 3D printers.

A closed source kit can be purchased on the web, but the cost is prohibitive for large quantities.
So I have scoured the web for info about the controller used in the 3D printer, MiniRambo v1.3.
Eventually, I managed to compile the schematics enclosed in this github project.

I have used KiCAD v5.1 to design a PCB similar in dimensions to the closed source kit.
Reason being the availability of ready made 3D enclosure(s), the recommended one can be found here:

Dimensions for the PCB were "recovered" using MeshLab on the above 3D enclosure(s).
