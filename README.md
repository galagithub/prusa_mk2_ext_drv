This is a PCB made to replace the X and Y drivers used the Prusa MK2(S) or MK2.5(S) series of 3D printers.

Initially, a similar closed source project was found here:
https://vmod.wordpress.com/prusa-mk2s-ext-driver-board-v2-3/

However, I wanted several of those kits and the cost was prohibitive, so I have scoured the web for info about the controller used in the 3D printer, MiniRambo v1.3.

I have used KiCAD v5.1 to design a PCB similar in dimensions to the above closed source project, reason being the availability of ready made 3D enclosure(s), the recommended one can be found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2777899
